# C implementation of BIP32 path template parser finite state machine

This repository contains an implementation of specification of the parser for BIP32 path templates
described in [bip-path-templates.mediawiki](https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_parse_tplaplus_spec/blob/master/bip-path-templates.mediawiki)
and specified by TLA+ specification at [https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_parse_tplaplus_spec](https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_parse_tplaplus_spec)

The implementation is in `bip32template.c`, public definitions is in `bip32template.h`

The code should be useable without standard library, (except for asserts).
It only imports `<limits.h>`, `<stdint.h>` and `<assert.h>`.

Type `make test` or just `make` to run tests against included `test/test_data.json` that was
generated by applying TLC checker to TLA+ spec with some post-processing.

Please look at `test/test.c` for examples of using the public functions.
